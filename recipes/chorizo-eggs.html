    <p>This is an image of Chorizo and Eggs, I think mine are better. I will tell 
        you how to make them now.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Serving Chorizo</li>
        <li>Half a Green or Red Bell Pepper (or Both!)</li>
        <li>1/4 of a Spanish Onion</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps of Creation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat up a medium sized skillet over Medium High heat</li>
        <li>Dice your Peppers and Onions and add them to the skillet along with 
            a half tablespoon of oil.</li>
        <li>Once your onions and peppers have softened and are starting to brown, add 
            in your chorizo.
        </li>
        <li>Break up your chorizo and brown it along the onions and peppers.</li>
        <li>Create your two spaces for you to crack your egss.</li>
        <li>Crack your eggs into your spaces and immediately break the yolk and mix 
            everything together until your eggs have cooked through. 
        </li>
        <li>Add to plate and eat in 20 seconds. (I like to eat this with a tortilla. Either
            making a taco or breaking the tortilla off to use as a spoon.)</li>
    </ol>

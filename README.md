# odin-recipes
This is my first project following the Odin Project. 
I have created a website containing a few of my favorite recipes. 
The Main index page simply links the three recipes contained on my website. 
Each recipe is stored on a seperate web page. I have created one smoothie recipe, one turkey sandwich recipe, and one chorizo and eggs recipe. 
I hope you enjoy.
